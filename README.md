<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Santa Clause has a very stressful season and asked us to help him track his gifts! We created a web app that that can track the gifts you need to buy for family, friends, co-workers, elves, etc. Once the user logs in they can save information pertaining to the person they want to give a gift to such as their name, budget, relationship(we all know how confusing those can get). As if that wasn't enough you can also store information pertaining to the gift as well such as cost and even where to buy! Now you can put your feet up, relax and enjoy a nice hot cup of Java(script), Santa gave it 2 elves up!
